# Cardiovascular Disease Dataset Analysis

## Task Description

In this exercise, you will analyze the Cardiovascular Disease dataset to extract various insights and perform calculations using Python and SQL. The dataset contains information about individuals' health metrics such as age, gender, weight, height, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease status.

## Task Objectives

- Practice data analysis and manipulation using Python and SQL.
- Calculate descriptive statistics and derived metrics from the dataset.
- Utilize libraries such as Pandas for data processing and SQL for querying.

## Task Instructions

### Dataset Description

You will work with the Cardiovascular Disease dataset, which contains information about individuals' health metrics and cardiovascular disease status. The dataset is provided in a CSV format and includes fields such as age, gender, height, weight, systolic blood pressure (ap_hi), diastolic blood pressure (ap_lo), and the presence of cardiovascular disease.

### Task Requirements

#### Easy Tasks:

- Calculate the average age of individuals.
- Count the number of males and females in the dataset.

#### Medium Tasks:

- Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each individual.
- Find the percentage of individuals with cardiovascular disease.

#### Hard Tasks:

- Determine the correlation between age and the presence of cardiovascular disease.
- Find the average systolic and diastolic blood pressure for individuals with and without cardiovascular disease.

### Implementation Guidelines

- Use Python with Pandas library for data loading, manipulation, and calculation of descriptive statistics.
- Use SQL for querying the dataset to perform more complex calculations such as correlation and grouping.
- Document your code with comments to explain the purpose of each step and calculation.
- Ensure that your Python code can read the dataset from a CSV file and your SQL code can execute queries against the dataset.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Accuracy:** Ensure that your calculations are accurate and reflect the correct insights from the dataset.
- **Efficiency:** Write efficient code that can handle the dataset size without significant performance issues.
- **Clarity:** Organize your code logically and provide clear explanations for each step.
- **Compliance:** Ensure that your solution addresses all the specified tasks and requirements.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit your Python code files along with any SQL scripts used for analysis.
- Include a brief summary or documentation explaining your approach, methods used, and any challenges encountered during the analysis.

Best of luck with the analysis! Remember to test your code thoroughly and verify the accuracy of your calculations. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask.
